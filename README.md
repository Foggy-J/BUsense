### A simple backup solution for PfSense/OPNsense.
## Why BUsense?
BUsense, or Backup-sense, was built from the ground up as a simple solution for backing up a PfSense or OPNsense installation. With a firewall being the core of many networks, it is crucial that this component is backed up. However, many still overlook this. BUsense was created so backups can be performed quickly and easy, configured exactly as the user wanted.
## Features
- Backup either through SSH or web console
- Web GUI for monitoring backups
- Push backups to Git for version control
- Webhook integration for alerts to Microsoft Teams, Slack or Discord
- Configurable options such as backup interval or backup location

## Future Plans
- Encrypted backups to keep credential data secret
- Multiple nodes backed up in one BUsense app
- More configurable backup interval (specific days etc.)
- Password protected GUI
